1. I spent about 4 hours working on the technical test. I would add error handling given the time. 

2. The concept of test driven development and using the tests as living documentation is interesting. Often times the intended behaviour of functions gets muddied 
    as functionality is revised and having a clear reference for intended behaviour is useful. 


3. I would understand the high level purpose of each function and write the tests for edge cases. I haven't had to do this before. 


4. The home page has unneccessary clutter with images that are grouped with a button that just scrolls up to the search. I would either removed this or provide thumbnail links for local/featured restaurants. 

5. { "firstName": "Harman", "lastName": "Bajwa", "gender": "Male", "employer": "TCS", "role": "software Dev", "favouriteSport": "basketball", "favouriteTeam": "Toronto Raptors" }
